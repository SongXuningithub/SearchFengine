He's also a teacher who has had a tremendous influence on people around the world. Correspondent Becky Quick profiles Buffett and some of the many people whose lives have been influenced, and even changed, by his investment advice and life lessons. Some are famous, and others unknown  everyday folks, some running small ventures, who feel a connection to one of the wealthiest people on the planet.

    "content": "About Warren Buffett ArchiveSkip NavigationSearchCNBC.comAnnual MeetingsCNBC InterviewsBuffett A-ZTimelineDocumentaryAboutAbout the Warren Buffett Archive Warren Buffett's enormous financial success, along with his middle-American common sense, modest lifestyle and self-deprecating sense of humor, have helped make him one of the world's most famous, and admired, billionaires. Fans around the world see him as an approachable role model for their own success. Once a year, at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, thousands of them gather in Omaha for a marathon five-hour question and answer session with Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger. They cover a wide array of topics, with a focus on what they look for when they invest and how they've built Berkshire into a 485 billion giant. For decades, the only way to see and hear them was to be in the room itself. Until live streaming began in 2016, those attending, including journalists, were not allowed to make or release any video or audio recordings. Now, for the first time, Berkshire is publicly sharing the videos it started making in 1994 for its own internal records. They form the core of this archive. CNBC has digitally curated these 122 hours of recordings, allowing you to see the sessions in their entirety, accompanied by synchronized transcripts. We've also created hundreds of video excerpts, along with annual highlight reels and collections of clips focused on a variety of subjects. Hours of CNBC interviews with Buffett are also included. All of the material is searchable. Along with Berkshire, we hope this archive will be an enduring, valuable, informative, and entertaining resource for serious students of Buffett as well as casual fans curious to learn more about the Oracle of Omaha. 12.6BThe estimated amount Warren Buffetts wealth jumped in 2013 alone, was around 12.7 billion.11The age that Warren Buffett bought his first stock, Cities Service Preferred for 38 apiece.53KThe amount of money Warren Buffett amassed was the equivalent of 53,000 in today's dollars by the time he was 16. About Warren Buffett Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has amassed a fortune worth more than 80 billion. He and his Berkshire business partner, Charlie Munger, have invested in everything from Coca-Cola to Heinz ketchup to IBM computers to Dairy Queen and Duracell, not to mention insurance companies, media companies, railroads and real estate. But it hasn't all been accumulation for Buffett. He has pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to charity. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on Aug. 30, 1930, the second of three children of Leila and Howard Buffett. His paternal grandparents had a grocery business. His father was in the investment business and served on the Omaha school board before being elected to Congress in 1942 as a Republican. At age 11, Buffett made his first stock purchase  three shares of Cities Service preferred at 38 per share. After the stock plunged and then rose to 40, he quickly sold his holdings, only to later see it surge. That taught him a big lesson  it's not a good idea to try to guess when to buy a stock and when to unload it. Charlie Munger, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett are interviewed on May 4, 2015 for CNBCs Squawk Box.Photo: Lacy OTooleCNBC As a teenager, Buffett delivered newspapers in Washington, earning enough to invest in a Nebraska farm. Buffett enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School at age 17, and after transferring, he graduated two years later from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, with a bachelor's in business administration. He went on to Columbia University for graduate school, where he was mentored by value-investing guru Benjamin Graham. Aside from his parents, Buffett considered Graham his greatest teacher. The Intelligent Investor, Grahams 1949 book, changed my life, Buffett told shareholders in 2013. (It) gave me a philosophy, a bedrock philosophy, on investing that made sense. Buffett and Susan \"Susie\" Thompson were married in 1952 and had three children, Susan, Howard and Peter. The couple purchased a home in Omaha where they raised their family and where Buffett lives to this day. Like young Warren, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger worked at Buffett's grandfather's grocery store in Omaha. But the two future, joined-at-the-hip, partners didn't meet until years later, in 1959, when an investor client of the then-29-year-old Buffett introduced them. Age 35 at the time, Munger was a California-based lawyer who had come back to his native Omaha to close his late father's legal practice. They hit it off and stayed in contact despite living half a continent away from each other. Buffett QuotesYou don't need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQWarren Buffett, American Business Magnate In 1962, Buffett started investing in Berkshire Hathaway, a troubled textile manufacturing company in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In what he would later call his \"dumbest\" stock purchase ever, he took control of Berkshire in 1965 and \"fought\" the failing textile business for 20 years before finally giving up. At the same time, however, he started to use Berkshire as a holding company for the many businesses and stocks he purchased over the following decades. Working together informally for many years, Munger helped modify Buffett's investment strategy, tweaking Graham's philosophy of buying bargain-priced securities and selling them when their prices rose. Munger guided Buffett toward buying excellent companies at a fair price and holding onto them. They both cite the 1972 purchase of See's Candies as a turning point. Munger formally joined Berkshire as vice chairman in 1978. In 1977, Susie Buffett moved to San Francisco to pursue a musical career. They remained married, however, and stayed in daily contact, often spending holidays together. She also introduced him to Astrid Menks, who worked at an Omaha caf where Susie performed. Menks moved in with Buffett in 1978 with his wife's approval. The three sent out Christmas cards signed \"Warren, Susie and Astrid,\" according to a biographer. In 2004, shortly before she died with Buffett at her side, Susie told an interviewer that Menks \"takes great care of him, and he appreciates it and I appreciate it. Shes a wonderful person. Two years later, Menks and Buffett married on his 76th birthday, when she was 60. Charlie Munger, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett are interviewed on May 4, 2015 for CNBCs Squawk Box.Image courtesy of Lacy OTooleCNBC In 2010, Buffett and Bill Gates founded The Giving Pledge to encourage wealthy people donate half their net worth to charity. Buffett has promised to pledge 99 percent of his fortune. Buffett announced in 2015 that upon his death, his son Howard will become the unpaid nonexecutive chairman of Berkshire's board. With typical Buffettian good humor, he discussed the Berkshire succession in his chairman's letter a decade ago. \"I've reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death  abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term 'thinking outside the box.'\"  Marty Steinberg is an editor at CNBC.com More From Warren Buffett ArchiveSign up for the Buffett Guide to Investing and the Buffett Watch Newsletterwatch nowVIDEO01:44:37Charlie Munger's final CNBC interviewwatch nowVIDEO02:55:11Morning Session - 2024 Meeting",

He will ask the board to give the job to Vice Chair Greg Abel, the executive who was designated years to be Buffett's successor as chief executive officer. Earlier, Buffett, Abel and insurance chief Ajit Jain discuss tariffs and trade, Berkshire's enormous cash pile, and why investors shouldn't overreact to the stock market's wild swings in the first few months of President Trump's second term. Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters Berkshire Hathaway's per-share market value increased by 25.5 in 2024, giving it a nine-year winning streak. The benchmark SP 500 index with dividends included almost matched Berkshire's performance with a gain of 25.0 for its second straight annual increase. In his letter, Buffett did not explain why the company's cash had reached a record 334 billion. He did downplay its size, writing, \"Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities,\" in the form of both publicly-traded stocks and wholly-owned subsidiaries. He also noted that since is 94 years old, it would not be long before Greg Abel replaces him as CEO. He did not, however, provide any specifics on when that might happen.READ 2024 LETTER (DATED FEB. 22, 2025) More From the Meetingwatch nowVIDEO08:31'I think the time has arrived'watch nowVIDEO01:18'Tim Cook has made Berkshire a lot more money' than I havewatch nowVIDEO02:53'Trade should not be a weapon'watch nowVIDEO03:50We'll hold our Japanese stocks for '50 years or forever'watch nowVIDEO03:37Berkshire will be patient with its big cash pilewatch nowVIDEO03:09Buffett: I was very lucky to have been born in the U.S.watch nowVIDEO03:01Berkshire insurance chief encouraged by GEICO's turnaroundwatch nowVIDEO03:20Why Buffett worries about the U.S. dollarwatch nowVIDEO03:47Berkshire can't compete with private equity in life insurancewatch nowVIDEO03:38Market moves in first months of Trump's second term are 'really nothing'watch nowVIDEO02:51Driverless cars will change auto insurance 'dramatically'watch nowVIDEO02:47Berkshire's 'great culture' will be an asset in years aheadwatch nowVIDEO03:17Buffett: We could exit utility business over wildfire liabilitywatch nowVIDEO02:32'The cathedral and the casino'watch nowVIDEO04:22U.S. needs to reduce its budget deficitsLoad More",

It wasn't, however, the first time he and partner Charlie Munger have been critical of cryptocurrencies.2013: Munger has \"no confidence\" in bitcoinwatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"Of our 49 billion, we haven't moved any to bitcoin\"A few minutes later in the same \"Squawk Box\" interview, Buffett explained why he thinks some proponents get angry when cryptocurrencies are criticized. As far back as the 2013 annual meeting, Buffett and Munger have their doubts that the then four-year-old digital currency bitcoin would ever be widely adopted. At the time, one bitcoin was valued at around 130.2014: Bitcoin is \"not a currency\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"Very speculative  Buck Rogers-type thing\"The following year, Buffett still doesn't see a long-term future for bitcoin. Appearing on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in March, he says he wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't exist after 10 or 20 years. Around that time, the price of one bitcoin ranged between 450 and 700.2014: \"It's a mirage\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"Stay away from it\"A few days later, Buffett was back on \"Squawk Box,\" appearing with Quicken Loans Founder  Chairman Dan Gilbert to promote an NCAA basketball tournament bracket contest they were sponsoring. Gilbert asked Buffett about bitcoin.2018: Cryptocurrencies heading to a \"bad ending\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"We'll never have a position in them\"Late in 2017, bitcoin topped out a spectacular year-long rally by hitting almost 18,000 on December 15. It then fell sharply from that high. On \"Squawk Box\" a few weeks later, Buffett was still staying far away from cryptocurrencies.2018: \"Trading turds\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"It's just dementia\"Just before appearing before thousands of shareholders at the 2018 Berkshire annual meeting on May 5, CNBC's Becky Quick tweeted that Buffett told her bitcoin is \"probably rat poison squared,\" one-upping his partner Charlie Munger who had called it simply \"rat poison.\" Buffett and Munger didn't use those words on stage, but they didn't hold back on their criticism of cryptocurrencies.2018: Bitcoin is \"creating nothing\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"They're just going to sit there\"Two days later, Buffett was on \"Squawk Box\" comparing bitcoin to another \"non-productive\" asset he's been very critical of over the years: gold.2018: Bitcoin bulls depend on the \"mob growing\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"They want more people joining the crowd\"A few minutes later in the same \"Squawk Box\" interview, Buffett explained why he thinks some proponents get angry when cryptocurrencies are criticized.2018: Munger and Gates separate the science from the speculationwatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"It's a scumball activity\"When Charlie Munger and Bill Gates join the May 5 \"Squawk Box\" conversation, bitcoin comes up again. While admitting it's \"clever computer science,\" Munger argues cryptocurrencies are \"worthless artificial gold\" that facilitates \"illicit activity.\" Gates acknowledges the underlying blockchain technology is a \"good thing,\" but thinks the price gains are being driven by unwarranted speculation.2018: One-word warningwatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"Beware\"In June, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon joins Buffett for a CNBC interview on their call for companies to stop issuing short-term earnings forecasts. While noting a few months before that blockchain technology could be useful, Dimon had called bitcoin a \"fraud,\" a comment he later said he regretted. On \"Squawk Box,\" Dimon appeared reluctant to dive into the subject, but did have a short bit of advice.2019: \"It attracts charlatans\"watch nowVIDEO03:07VIDEO03:07Warren Buffett: 'Bitcoin has no unique value at all'Several months later, Buffett's opinion hasn't changed at all. In a February \"Squawk Box\" interview, he calls the idea that bitcoin will have long-term value a \"delusion,\" although he does see potential in the underlying blockchain technology. Buffett concedes he does have sympathy for those who optimists who hoped to change their lives bought bought when enthusiasm, and prices, were high.

He held out hope, however, that the airline's CEO might be able to cut costs in what he acknowledged would be an \"enormously tough negotiating job.\"1996: USAir investment improveswatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00I should have \"gone out to a bar\" insteadTwo years later, USAir had a new CEO and a brighter outlook. It also still had its \"out of line costs.\" Buffett told the 1996 shareholders meeting the investment looked \"considerably better,\" but, even so, it was a mistake that Charlie Munger wouldn't let him forget anytime soon.1997: Praise for CEO's \"terrific job\"watch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"It has been a very pleasant surprise\"By 1997, the investment was looking even better. Buffett gave credit to Stephen Wolf, the airline's CEO, for improving its financial performance and catching up with scheduled dividend payments to Berkshire. Buffett hoped Wolf might even be able to \"nullify\" his mistake.1998: Bailed out, with no desire to jump back inwatch nowVIDEO02:06VIDEO02:06\"It is not a business that intrigues us\"Early in 1998, with help from a booming stock price, US Airways paid back its 358 million loan with common shares that were sold for 574 million. Buffett's \"mistake\" had also brought in around 240 million in dividends. Three months later, Buffett told shareholders Berkshire wouldn't rule out making another airline loan, but wasn't interested in buying an airline's common stock.2013: Reduced competition lifts airlines, but no bite from Berkshirewatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"Sexy\" airline industry attracts capitalFifteen years later, following two bankruptcies and a reverse merger with America West, US Airways was preparing to combine with American Airlines, one of a series of mergers that sharply reduced the number of competing carriers. At the 2013 shareholders meeting, Buffett was skeptical when asked about the industry's improved profitability.2017: Berkshire puts billions in airlines, but Buffett remembers the bankruptcieswatch nowVIDEO00:00VIDEO00:00\"You couldn't pick a tougher industry\"Just three years later, Berkshire surprised the investment world by taking multi-billion dollar stakes in American, Delta, United, and Southwest. But at the 2017 shareholders meeting, Buffett didn't sound very enthusiastic about it.More From Buffett A-ZBuffett: Never bet against AmericaBuffett on bitcoin and cryptocurrenciesThe Berkshire Hathaway Reading List",
